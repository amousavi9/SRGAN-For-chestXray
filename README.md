# [ SRGAN for chestXray](https://github.com/amousavi9/SRGAN-For-chestXray)
Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely-used and cost-effective technology for chest screening and diagnosis of Pulmonary diseases. An always concerned improvement about CXR is to reduce X-ray radiation while achieving ultra-high quality imaging with fine structural details since CXR involves ionizing radiation and tolerance of different populations. This work applies SRGAN to accurately recover high-resolution (HR) CXR images from low-resolution (LR) counterparts.
